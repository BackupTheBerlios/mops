Fixed two very serious design-time bugs: long time ago i decided what type of
comparsion to choose: by md5 or by name/version/arch/build. Then i choosed names.
And it was bad choose, but it appear only now. This causes that maybe absolutely different packages
with same names are merged together, causing some packages disappear from database. FIXED =) Now it
compares by checksum.

Changed the visual way of loading data in table.
Now, by default, table is hidden (a splash is there instead).
So, loading proceeds faster.
Next, package filter applies at load. From now on, "ALL" package list
is an "extreme way".
Also, package table header now shows the current group.
----------------------------
revision 1.27
date: 2007/04/18 20:24:13;  author: i27249;  state: Exp;  lines: +5 -5
Few key optimizations: 1) ReadFile - now it reads 10000000x faster!
2) fill_filelist: complete rewrite; now uses ReadFileStrings and ReadFile.
Still not a perfect way, but already much much faster (approximately 6x than before - kdeartwork installs 7s (vs. 17s before)

Fixed two very serious design-time bugs: long time ago i decided what type of
comparsion to choose: by md5 or by name/version/arch/build. Then i choosed names.
And it was bad choose, but it appear only now. This causes that maybe absolutely different packages
with same names are merged together, causing some packages disappear from database. FIXED =) Now it
compares by checksum.

Changed the visual way of loading data in table.
Now, by default, table is hidden (a splash is there instead).
So, loading proceeds faster.
Next, package filter applies at load. From now on, "ALL" package list
is an "extreme way".
Also, package table header now shows the current group.

Few key optimizations: 1) ReadFile - now it reads 10000000x faster!
2) fill_filelist: complete rewrite; now uses ReadFileStrings and ReadFile.
Still not a perfect way, but already much much faster (approximately 6x than before - kdeartwork installs 7s (vs. 17s before)

Core:

Now, by default, table is hidden (a splash is there instead).

Also, package table header now shows the current group.

Fixed two very serious design-time bugs: long time ago i decided what type of
comparsion to choose: by md5 or by name/version/arch/build. Then i choosed names.
And it was bad choose, but it appear only now. This causes that maybe absolutely different packages
with same names are merged together, causing some packages disappear from database. FIXED =) Now it
compares by checksum.

revision 1.1
date: 2007/04/18 23:00:35;  author: i27249;  state: Exp;
Changed the visual way of loading data in table.
Now, by default, table is hidden (a splash is there instead).
So, loading proceeds faster.
Next, package filter applies at load. From now on, "ALL" package list
is an "extreme way".
Also, package table header now shows the current group.

Few key optimizations: 1) ReadFile - now it reads 10000000x faster!
2) fill_filelist: complete rewrite; now uses ReadFileStrings and ReadFile.
Still not a perfect way, but already much much faster (approximately 6x than before - kdeartwork installs 7s (vs. 17s before)

Fixed two very serious design-time bugs: long time ago i decided what type of
comparsion to choose: by md5 or by name/version/arch/build. Then i choosed names.
And it was bad choose, but it appear only now. This causes that maybe absolutely different packages
with same names are merged together, causing some packages disappear from database. FIXED =) Now it
compares by checksum.

...INTERNATIONAL DESCRIPTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED!
Nobody knows how buggy is it for now (no tests performed - just written),
but I hope it will work.
Compiled on MacOS X 10.4.8 using gcc 4.1.2
Secondary changes: cosmetic changes in interface, little error handling
improvements
And, I've reserved a place for future improvements - rating system and international changelogs.

NOTE: DATABASE FIELDS CHANGED, PLEASE UPDATE!

revision 1.3

A very very LOTS of changes in code!
1. Seriously modified architecture of code: now SQL is in SQLProxy and SQLiteDB, all database routines are in mpkgDatabase object, and so on.
2. Fully separated between SQL implementation and database code. Now it is possible to use any database type (just modify the SQLProxy to use this)
3. Big amount of bugfixes: I have found lots of bugs while I did revision, and most of them are fixed. I don't understand how it even compiles before...

So, be careful writing new code: I repeat, ARCHITECTURE CHANGED.

It HAPPENZ! =) A linuxpackages repositories have now supported!
Only data fetching, in real (installation still unsupported), but it is a great progress =)
Also, I've temporarily disabled international descriptions support in get_packagelist,
because retrieving of this takes too much resources and CPU time (will fix it in future).

The thing which has been awaited for a very long time:

I fuck the autotools, it's monsterous and sucks. This tool is pretty good.
Of cource, just beta release )

Fixed two very serious design-time bugs: long time ago i decided what type of
comparsion to choose: by md5 or by name/version/arch/build. Then i choosed names.
And it was bad choose, but it appear only now. This causes that maybe absolutely different packages
with same names are merged together, causing some packages disappear from database. FIXED =) Now it
compares by checksum.

Core:
Fix: cd-rom mounting (mount was performed, but not detected as successful. Fallback to system("mount ...") for now). Fixed.
Fix: console event bus (didn't show the last available reply option). Fixed.
Fix: ReadFile returned garbage if the file is empty. Fixed.
GUI:
Repository dialog remastering completed. Added cd-rom volume detection. Added authentication options.
Some internal behavior fixes.

in reader file.

A very very LOTS of changes in code!
1. Seriously modified architecture of code: now SQL is in SQLProxy and SQLiteDB, all database routines are in mpkgDatabase object, and so on.
2. Fully separated between SQL implementation and database code. Now it is possible to use any database type (just modify the SQLProxy to use this)
3. Big amount of bugfixes: I have found lots of bugs while I did revision, and most of them are fixed. I don't understand how it even compiles before...

So, be careful writing new code: I repeat, ARCHITECTURE CHANGED.

NEW NEW NEW!!! Finally, repository support is implemented!!!
But stop emotions, get the fuck'ts:
1. Installing from repository is still very-very buggy.
2. Currently we support only FTP and HTTP repositories
3. All download operations are done using wget and system() function, so
   the network module has a temporary implementation

So, I post this to CVS for you to test and catch all bugs.
Also, I have opened test repository at: http://mopslinux.glstudio.by.ru/mpkg_repository/

NOTE: please write all URL's and paths in config with ending slash, or it will fail to parse it correctly.

So, test it and send me a bug reports!

revision 1.6
date: 2007/02/14 06:50:58;  author: i27249;  state: Exp;  lines: +8 -3
The main changes is....
...INTERNATIONAL DESCRIPTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED!
Nobody knows how buggy is it for now (no tests performed - just written),
but I hope it will work.
Compiled on MacOS X 10.4.8 using gcc 4.1.2
Secondary changes: cosmetic changes in interface, little error handling
improvements
And, I've reserved a place for future improvements - rating system and international changelogs.

NOTE: DATABASE FIELDS CHANGED, PLEASE UPDATE!

----------------------------
revision 1.4
date: 2006/12/29 20:56:18;  author: i27249;  state: Exp;  lines: +9 -2
NEW NEW NEW!!! Finally, repository support is implemented!!!
But stop emotions, get the fuck'ts:
1. Installing from repository is still very-very buggy.
2. Currently we support only FTP and HTTP repositories
3. All download operations are done using wget and system() function, so
   the network module has a temporary implementation

So, I post this to CVS for you to test and catch all bugs.
Also, I have opened test repository at: http://mopslinux.glstudio.by.ru/mpkg_repository/

NOTE: please write all URL's and paths in config with ending slash, or it will fail to parse it correctly.

So, test it and send me a bug reports!

Crazy night...
Core:
Fix: cd-rom mounting (mount was performed, but not detected as successful. Fallback to system("mount ...") for now). Fixed.
Fix: console event bus (didn't show the last available reply option). Fixed.
Fix: ReadFile returned garbage if the file is empty. Fixed.
GUI:
Repository dialog remastering completed. Added cd-rom volume detection. Added authentication options.
Some internal behavior fixes.

Changed the visual way of loading data in table.
Now, by default, table is hidden (a splash is there instead).
So, loading proceeds faster.
Next, package filter applies at load. From now on, "ALL" package list
is an "extreme way".
Also, package table header now shows the current group.

Lots of bugfixes, started repository implementation.
Added != and == operators to dataunits.h data types.
Note: repository fetching doesn't fully implemented for now! (mpkg update)
Also, added config file: now configuration is stored in /etc/mpkg.xml, rather than
in reader file.

revision 1.7

A very very LOTS of changes in code!
1. Seriously modified architecture of code: now SQL is in SQLProxy and SQLiteDB, all database routines are in mpkgDatabase object, and so on.
2. Fully separated between SQL implementation and database code. Now it is possible to use any database type (just modify the SQLProxy to use this)
3. Big amount of bugfixes: I have found lots of bugs while I did revision, and most of them are fixed. I don't understand how it even compiles before...

So, be careful writing new code: I repeat, ARCHITECTURE CHANGED.

Fixed two very serious design-time bugs: long time ago i decided what type of
comparsion to choose: by md5 or by name/version/arch/build. Then i choosed names.
And it was bad choose, but it appear only now. This causes that maybe absolutely different packages
with same names are merged together, causing some packages disappear from database. FIXED =) Now it
compares by checksum.

Important changes:
1. remove_package and purge_package are merged together. There was a lot of same code (99,9%),
and this splitting were made troubles in sorting. From now on, do not use mpkgDatabase::purge_package,
use remove_package instead.

2. All package processing (removing, installing, and even downloading) is now sorted by dependency tree.

Fixed two very serious design-time bugs: long time ago i decided what type of
comparsion to choose: by md5 or by name/version/arch/build. Then i choosed names.
And it was bad choose, but it appear only now. This causes that maybe absolutely different packages
with same names are merged together, causing some packages disappear from database. FIXED =) Now it
compares by checksum.

NEW NEW NEW!!! Finally, repository support is implemented!!!
But stop emotions, get the fuck'ts:
1. Installing from repository is still very-very buggy.
2. Currently we support only FTP and HTTP repositories
3. All download operations are done using wget and system() function, so
   the network module has a temporary implementation

So, I post this to CVS for you to test and catch all bugs.
Also, I have opened test repository at: http://mopslinux.glstudio.by.ru/mpkg_repository/

NOTE: please write all URL's and paths in config with ending slash, or it will fail to parse it correctly.

So, test it and send me a bug reports!

Important changes:
1. remove_package and purge_package are merged together. There was a lot of same code (99,9%),
and this splitting were made troubles in sorting. From now on, do not use mpkgDatabase::purge_package,
use remove_package instead.

2. All package processing (removing, installing, and even downloading) is now sorted by dependency tree.

It HAPPENZ! =) A linuxpackages repositories have now supported!
Only data fetching, in real (installation still unsupported), but it is a great progress =)
Also, I've temporarily disabled international descriptions support in get_packagelist,
because retrieving of this takes too much resources and CPU time (will fix it in future).
----------------------------
revision 1.10
date: 2007/02/14 06:50:58;  author: i27249;  state: Exp;  lines: +39 -1
The main changes is....
...INTERNATIONAL DESCRIPTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED!
Nobody knows how buggy is it for now (no tests performed - just written),
but I hope it will work.
Compiled on MacOS X 10.4.8 using gcc 4.1.2
Secondary changes: cosmetic changes in interface, little error handling
improvements
And, I've reserved a place for future improvements - rating system and international changelogs.

NOTE: DATABASE FIELDS CHANGED, PLEASE UPDATE!
----------------------------

Lots of bugfixes, started repository implementation.
Added != and == operators to dataunits.h data types.
Note: repository fetching doesn't fully implemented for now! (mpkg update)
Also, added config file: now configuration is stored in /etc/mpkg.xml, rather than
in reader file.
----------------------------
revision 1.5
date: 2006/12/26 18:57:11;  author: i27249;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -1
A very very LOTS of changes in code!
1. Seriously modified architecture of code: now SQL is in SQLProxy and SQLiteDB, all database routines are in mpkgDatabase object, and so on.
2. Fully separated between SQL implementation and database code. Now it is possible to use any database type (just modify the SQLProxy to use this)
3. Big amount of bugfixes: I have found lots of bugs while I did revision, and most of them are fixed. I don't understand how it even compiles before...

So, be careful writing new code: I repeat, ARCHITECTURE CHANGED.
----------------------------

Crazy night...
Core:
Fix: cd-rom mounting (mount was performed, but not detected as successful. Fallback to system("mount ...") for now). Fixed.
Fix: console event bus (didn't show the last available reply option). Fixed.
Fix: ReadFile returned garbage if the file is empty. Fixed.
GUI:
Repository dialog remastering completed. Added cd-rom volume detection. Added authentication options.
Some internal behavior fixes.

NEW NEW NEW!!! Finally, repository support is implemented!!!
But stop emotions, get the fuck'ts:
1. Installing from repository is still very-very buggy.
2. Currently we support only FTP and HTTP repositories
3. All download operations are done using wget and system() function, so
   the network module has a temporary implementation

So, I post this to CVS for you to test and catch all bugs.
Also, I have opened test repository at: http://mopslinux.glstudio.by.ru/mpkg_repository/

NOTE: please write all URL's and paths in config with ending slash, or it will fail to parse it correctly.

So, test it and send me a bug reports!

A very very LOTS of changes in code!
1. Seriously modified architecture of code: now SQL is in SQLProxy and SQLiteDB, all database routines are in mpkgDatabase object, and so on.
2. Fully separated between SQL implementation and database code. Now it is possible to use any database type (just modify the SQLProxy to use this)
3. Big amount of bugfixes: I have found lots of bugs while I did revision, and most of them are fixed. I don't understand how it even compiles before...

So, be careful writing new code: I repeat, ARCHITECTURE CHANGED.

Nobody knows how buggy is it for now (no tests performed - just written),

Secondary changes: cosmetic changes in interface, little error handling
improvements
And, I've reserved a place for future improvements - rating system and international changelogs.

revision 1.66
date: 2007/05/14 00:08:25;  author: i27249;  state: Exp;  lines: +27 -17
Important changes:
1. remove_package and purge_package are merged together. There was a lot of same code (99,9%),
and this splitting were made troubles in sorting. From now on, do not use mpkgDatabase::purge_package,
use remove_package instead.

2. All package processing (removing, installing, and even downloading) is now sorted by dependency tree.

Fixed two very serious design-time bugs: long time ago i decided what type of
comparsion to choose: by md5 or by name/version/arch/build. Then i choosed names.
And it was bad choose, but it appear only now. This causes that maybe absolutely different packages
with same names are merged together, causing some packages disappear from database. FIXED =) Now it
compares by checksum.

how it even works before... but seems it works sometimes (on each test set) =) In real, incorrect

It HAPPENZ! =) A linuxpackages repositories have now supported!
Only data fetching, in real (installation still unsupported), but it is a great progress =)
Also, I've temporarily disabled international descriptions support in get_packagelist,
because retrieving of this takes too much resources and CPU time (will fix it in future).

revision 1.13

NEW NEW NEW!!! Finally, repository support is implemented!!!
But stop emotions, get the fuck'ts:
1. Installing from repository is still very-very buggy.
2. Currently we support only FTP and HTTP repositories
3. All download operations are done using wget and system() function, so
   the network module has a temporary implementation

So, I post this to CVS for you to test and catch all bugs.
Also, I have opened test repository at: http://mopslinux.glstudio.by.ru/mpkg_repository/

NOTE: please write all URL's and paths in config with ending slash, or it will fail to parse it correctly.

So, test it and send me a bug reports!

Lots of bugfixes, started repository implementation.
Added != and == operators to dataunits.h data types.
Note: repository fetching doesn't fully implemented for now! (mpkg update)
Also, added config file: now configuration is stored in /etc/mpkg.xml, rather than
in reader file.
----------------------------
revision 1.11
date: 2006/12/26 18:57:11;  author: i27249;  state: Exp;  lines: +32 -15
A very very LOTS of changes in code!
1. Seriously modified architecture of code: now SQL is in SQLProxy and SQLiteDB, all database routines are in mpkgDatabase object, and so on.
2. Fully separated between SQL implementation and database code. Now it is possible to use any database type (just modify the SQLProxy to use this)
3. Big amount of bugfixes: I have found lots of bugs while I did revision, and most of them are fixed. I don't understand how it even compiles before...

So, be careful writing new code: I repeat, ARCHITECTURE CHANGED.

It HAPPENZ! =) A linuxpackages repositories have now supported!
Only data fetching, in real (installation still unsupported), but it is a great progress =)
Also, I've temporarily disabled international descriptions support in get_packagelist,
because retrieving of this takes too much resources and CPU time (will fix it in future).

The main changes is....
...INTERNATIONAL DESCRIPTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED!
Nobody knows how buggy is it for now (no tests performed - just written),
but I hope it will work.
Compiled on MacOS X 10.4.8 using gcc 4.1.2
Secondary changes: cosmetic changes in interface, little error handling
improvements
And, I've reserved a place for future improvements - rating system and international changelogs.

NOTE: DATABASE FIELDS CHANGED, PLEASE UPDATE!

Lots of bugfixes, started repository implementation.
Added != and == operators to dataunits.h data types.
Note: repository fetching doesn't fully implemented for now! (mpkg update)
Also, added config file: now configuration is stored in /etc/mpkg.xml, rather than
in reader file.
----------------------------
revision 1.5
date: 2006/12/26 18:57:11;  author: i27249;  state: Exp;  lines: +46 -5
A very very LOTS of changes in code!
1. Seriously modified architecture of code: now SQL is in SQLProxy and SQLiteDB, all database routines are in mpkgDatabase object, and so on.
2. Fully separated between SQL implementation and database code. Now it is possible to use any database type (just modify the SQLProxy to use this)
3. Big amount of bugfixes: I have found lots of bugs while I did revision, and most of them are fixed. I don't understand how it even compiles before...

So, be careful writing new code: I repeat, ARCHITECTURE CHANGED.

Fixed two very serious design-time bugs: long time ago i decided what type of
comparsion to choose: by md5 or by name/version/arch/build. Then i choosed names.
And it was bad choose, but it appear only now. This causes that maybe absolutely different packages
with same names are merged together, causing some packages disappear from database. FIXED =) Now it
compares by checksum.

...INTERNATIONAL DESCRIPTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED!
Nobody knows how buggy is it for now (no tests performed - just written),
but I hope it will work.
Compiled on MacOS X 10.4.8 using gcc 4.1.2

NEW NEW NEW!!! Finally, repository support is implemented!!!
But stop emotions, get the fuck'ts:
1. Installing from repository is still very-very buggy.
2. Currently we support only FTP and HTTP repositories
3. All download operations are done using wget and system() function, so
   the network module has a temporary implementation

So, I post this to CVS for you to test and catch all bugs.
Also, I have opened test repository at: http://mopslinux.glstudio.by.ru/mpkg_repository/

NOTE: please write all URL's and paths in config with ending slash, or it will fail to parse it correctly.

So, test it and send me a bug reports!

A very very LOTS of changes in code!
1. Seriously modified architecture of code: now SQL is in SQLProxy and SQLiteDB, all database routines are in mpkgDatabase object, and so on.
2. Fully separated between SQL implementation and database code. Now it is possible to use any database type (just modify the SQLProxy to use this)
3. Big amount of bugfixes: I have found lots of bugs while I did revision, and most of them are fixed. I don't understand how it even compiles before...

So, be careful writing new code: I repeat, ARCHITECTURE CHANGED.

Lots of bugfixes, started repository implementation.
Added != and == operators to dataunits.h data types.
Note: repository fetching doesn't fully implemented for now! (mpkg update)
Also, added config file: now configuration is stored in /etc/mpkg.xml, rather than
in reader file.
